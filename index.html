//class selectors are represented in : .classname{

}

//yes



//priority wise for css
inline>internal>external


//can i apply inline as well as internal to same element?
//yes 
//then inline will have that priority 


//id selector:
//it is applicable to only element 
//syntax: #idname{

}

//again the priorities based on selectors
//order of priority
id>class

block level:they always start on the new line
ex:div
inline level:they always start on the same line
ex:span

yes
